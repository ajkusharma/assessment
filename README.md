To build, run, and validate the result, we can follow these steps:
# Get this assessment.zip file 
# Set up a this Spring Boot project by pull this code.
# Copy the code snippets into their respective folders to their respective files.
# Build and run the application.
# Use a tool like Postman to send GET requests to the API endpoints, for example: http://localhost:8080/api/rewards/customers/1?month=3, where 1 is the customer ID and 3 is the number of months to look back.
# I have taken H2 Database , (http://localhost:8080/h2-console) to interact with the database and insert sample data to test
